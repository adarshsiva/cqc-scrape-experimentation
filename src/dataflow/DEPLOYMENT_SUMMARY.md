```
Pub/Sub Topic           Apache Beam              BigQuery Tables
dashboard-events   →    Streaming Pipeline   →   realtime_features
                             ↓                   realtime_features_aggregated
                        Vertex AI                 streaming_errors

gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-dataflow-streaming.yaml
```

### Testing
```bash
# Send test event
gcloud pubsub topics publish dashboard-events \
  --message='{"location_id":"test-123","event_type":"dashboard_interaction","timestamp":"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z","metrics":{"user_type":"public","page_views":1}}'

# Query results
bq query 'SELECT * FROM `machine-learning-exp-467008.cqc_dataset.realtime_features` ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10'
```
